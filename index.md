**dyGiLa** is a scalable software for Lattice Field Theory simulation of time-dependent [Ginzburg-Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginzburg%E2%80%93Landau_theory) [effective theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory) of p-wave superfluid targeted to Helium-3.

## Features

- **Scalable** and **Portable** on **hybrid** i.e., CPU-only or CPU-GPGPU hardwares.
- Lattice Field Theory backed simulation tool, statistic **ergodicity** is always be carefully considered.   
- dyGiLa provides readable and useful documentations which allow users to expand the usage of dyGiLa.
